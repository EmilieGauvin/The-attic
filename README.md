# The attic

This 3D model was realized for the purpose of my portfolio ( www.emiliegauvin.com/about ). 
It was built and texturized in Blender and sunrays were added in Three.js with a custom shader material. 
Move your cursor around to move the camera inside the model.
Built in Three.js and Blender
